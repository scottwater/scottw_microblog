				"content_text": "I am working on a significant update/rewrite of part of KickoffLabs. I had a task to work through what we do in a Sidekiq worker. It was late on Friday when I got to this part of the code, and I decided to punt on it until Monday.\n\nMonday morning, I grab a cup of coffee and sit down to finish this section off and see a comment I missed (and had missed for a long time). \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/92902/2023/f5wjcuawmaaokwf.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"99\" alt=\"Code Comment, Remove in August 2019\">\n\nOutside the screenshot, there is an if statement, ensuring this code was not executed in the last four years. Still, it was frustrating that we had missed removing it for so long. \n\nI figured ChatGPT would have a good solution to stay on top of this, but it mostly just tried to explain to me how to use comments. :)\n\nNext up, I asked on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scottw/status/1701244816217038929) (and [Ruby.Social](https://ruby.social/@Scottw/111047042095713444)): \n\n> Any suggestions (other than search) to ensure code like this gets cleaned up?\n\nFrom there, I got a lot of good suggestions. \n\nTwo Ruby gems looked interesting:\n\n* [todo_or_die](https://github.com/searls/todo_or_die)\n* [smart_todo](https://github.com/Shopify/smart_todo)\n\nIf I had to choose, I would go with todo_or_die since it would cause a failure/notification locally. I would rather not wait until there was a pull request/etc. \n\nThe rest of the suggestions included if statements and date checks. My favorite, and the one I will likely adopt going forward, is to wrap it in a test that [fails after a specific date](https://ruby.social/@p8/111047287492099475).  \n",

				"content_text": "My podcast listening usually fluctuates between what I am interested in and what I do while listening to podcasts. \n\nIn the past, it has been a lot about software and business, and I was usually listening while taking walks. \n\nThese days I usually listen while training at the gym, so my focus is not quite there for something profound like software or business. \n\nI do not have a true favorite, so please ignore the order. \n\n1. [Bill Simons](https://www.theringer.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast) - I wouldn't say this is my favorite, but certainly the one I listen to the most. Bill talks a lot about Basketball and Football, which are the two sports I enjoy the most (especially with a spin and some gambling). There is also a fair amount of celebrity/pop culture, which I skip 9 out of 10 times. \n\n2. [New Heights](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-heights-with-jason-and-travis-kelce/id1643745036). - This is a relatively new podcast from the Kelsey brothers in the NFL. It is by far the best athlete-driven podcast I have come across. It will be interesting to see what happens after the season is over (and more sadly if/when Jason retires)\n\n3. [The Steam Room](https://www.tntdrama.com/thesteamroompodcast) - Ernie Johnson is great, and Charles Barkley is a living legend. Enough said. \n\n4. [All-In](https://www.allinpodcast.co) - Rich guys discussing business/politics/etc. It probably shouldn't be as funny as it is, but so be it.\n\n5. [The Tim Ferris Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/) - This might be my longest-running podcast subscription. I started to tune out of the body hacking/etc. stuff, but I have come back for the other interviews. Tim does a great job digging in on questions, and his pre-research is top-notch. Even when someone is there with the goal of selling/launching something, you walk away with some deep insights. \n",
