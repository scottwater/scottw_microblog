				"content_html": "<p>For reasons I will share in another post, I was forced to move two personal projects off of Heroku and onto HatchBox. The first, ThocStock, went very smoothly. I deployed the code, set a couple of ENVs, verified everything worked as expected, and finally updated the DNS.</p>\n<p>The second app, HowIVSCode, proved to be a bit more of a challenge. The first commits were about 4.5 years ago. Like many side projects with no revenue, apart from some gem security updates, it has not seen many changes over the last four years.</p>\n<p>The app was primarily built on Rails 5, TailwindCSS, webpacker, Administrate, and Delayed Job.

After a while, it felt like I was running in circles, putting out new small fires. All solvable problems, but then it hit me. This app has a total of 3 models and a couple of controllers.

The reasoning for this makes sense, but in quickly trying to move to the most recent gem updates, I spun my tires here for far longer than I care to admit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"no-arrays-in-sqlite\">No Arrays in SQLite</h2>\n<p>When relational data is small and often just a word or two, I use an array in PostgreSQL.</p>\n<p>For example, a migration for a small blog post table might look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><div style=\"color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\">\n<table style=\"border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;\"><tr><td style=\"vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;\">\n<pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">1\n</span><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">2\n</span><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">3\n</span><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">4\n</span><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">5\n</span></code></pre></td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%\">\n<pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-ruby\" data-lang=\"ruby\">create_table <span style=\"color:#ed9d13\">:posts</span> <span style=\"color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\">do</span> |t|\n\tt.text <span style=\"color:#ed9d13\">:title</span>\n\tt.text <span style=\"color:#ed9d13\">:body</span>\n\tt.text <span style=\"color:#ed9d13\">:tags</span>, <span style=\"color:#ed9d13\">array</span>: <span style=\"color:#6ab825\">true</span>\n<span style=\"color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\">end</span>\n</code></pre></td></tr></table>\n</div>\n</div><p>I no longer need a separate <code>tags</code> table or a <code>tags_in_posts</code> related table. PostgreSQL provides the necessary functions to query this as needed.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are no Arrays in SQLite. However, all is not lost. SQLite does support JSON, so for now, I added a json column called data and the necessary arrays. This is just data I am recording, so we will have to see in the future if this holds up when querying by specific tags becomes necessary.</p>\n<h2 id=\"apply-warnings\">@apply warnings</h2>\n<p>For better or worse, I occasionally use @apply with my Tailwind CSS. VSCode kept complaining about (although it still worked) an <code>Unknown Rule</code>. The fix is to set the *.css file association to <code>tailwindcss</code>. Full details <a href=\"https://cssf1.com/how-to/fix-unknown-at-rule-tailwind-warning-vscode\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"default-layout-for-sitepress\">Default Layout for SitePress</h2>\n<p>My markdown content views previously used the markdown-views gem. This time around, I decided to go with SitePress. Overall, SitePress has been great to work with. However, one thing I struggled with was how to use a different layout for my content pages.</p>\n<p>With my SitePress pages, everything that is not the markdown body is set in a different Layout file. This way, I did not have to try and overly mix Markdown and ERB in my content (and as far as I can tell, you cannot even access SitePress&rsquo;s page variables</p>\n<p>I tried various ways to make this work, but I settled on creating a new controller derived from Sitepress::SiteController. Then, in my routes file, I specified that this controller would be used <code>sitepress_pages(controller: &quot;content&quot;)</code> for my pages.</p>\n<h2 id=\"meta-tags-with-sitepress\">Meta Tags with SitePress</h2>\n<p>Similar to the above concern, I wanted to be still able to set various meta tags via the meta-tags gem.</p>\n<p>Again, trying to avoid any ERB in my Markdown as much as possible, I added a meta section to my frontmatter and wired it up like this in the SitePress layout.</p>\n<h2 id=\"markdown-escaping-in-sitepress\">Markdown Escaping in SitePress</h2>\n<p>I have a Stimulus controller that adds your API key to the clipboard when you click on it. Previously, I rendered a partial which wired up the controller <code>&lt;%= render partial: &quot;auth_token&quot; %&gt;</code></p>\n<p>The partial approach still worked (I know, ERB in MD), but the <code>#</code> in  <code>data-action=&quot;click-&gt;copy-auth-key#copy</code> is causing RedCarpret (SitePress&rsquo;s markdown processer) to start escaping everything after. The markdown-views gem uses Commonmarker for processing markdown and doesn&rsquo;t appear to have this issue (I have tests to compare if someone is interested).</p>\n<p>If I were using more stimulus in the project, I would probably need to dig deeper and/or swap Markdown libraries. My usage was simple enough; I just dropped the data-action attribute and wired up an event listener in my controller.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><div style=\"color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\">\n<table style=\"border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;\"><tr><td style=\"vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;\">\n<pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">1\n</span><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">2\n</span><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">3\n</span><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">4\n</span><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">5\n</span><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">6\n</span><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">7\n</span><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">8\n</span><span style=\"margin-right:0.4em;padding:0 0.4em 0 0.4em;color:#686868\">9\n</span></code></pre></td>\n<td style=\"vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%\">\n<pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-javascript\" data-lang=\"javascript\"><span style=\"color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\">import</span> { Controller } from <span style=\"color:#ed9d13\">&#34;@hotwired/stimulus&#34;</span>;\n<span style=\"color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\">export</span> <span style=\"color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\">default</span> <span style=\"color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\">class</span> <span style=\"color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\">extends</span> Controller {\n  copy() {\n    navigator.clipboard.writeText(<span style=\"color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\">this</span>.element.innerText.trim());\n  }\n  initialize() {\n    <span style=\"color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\">this</span>.element.addEventListener(<span style=\"color:#ed9d13\">&#34;click&#34;</span>, <span style=\"color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\">this</span>.copy.bind(<span style=\"color:#6ab825;font-weight:bold\">this</span>))\n  }\n}\n</code></pre></td></tr></table>\n</div>\n</div><p>Sometimes, being lazy is the correct answer.</p>\n<h2 id=\"importing-data-from-pg-to-sqlite\">Importing Data from PG to Sqlite</h2>\n<p>Sadly, there does not appear to be an easy off-the-self option to go in this direction.
