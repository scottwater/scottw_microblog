			 <p>New Year, new ambitions: start your own business and take control of your time and finances.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the harsh reality: the adrenaline fades, and most give up within weeks.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a suggestion&hellip;</p>
<p>Dedicate your weekends this year. Spend four hours each on Saturday and Sunday building your business.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a solid month (26 days) of focused work without sacrificing sleep or your regular schedule.</p>
<p>Speed to market is overrated. Success comes from execution and continuous improvement, week after week, month after month.</p>

			 <p>20+ years of professionally building software, and here is how my last hour or so went.</p>
<p><code>heroku login</code> -&gt; <code>zsh: killed heroku login</code></p>
<p>hmmm&hellip;why did ZSH kill Heroku? It turns out it is just reporting what happened.</p>
<p>Open the crash reports and get a bunch of text I barely understand.</p>
<p>I remember that I have a second brain that knows what this crap means. <strong>ChatGPT, can you help me?</strong></p>
<p>It does a decent job of educating me on what the reports (segfault on the main thread implies not even the hand of God can save this process).</p>
<p>When in doubt, just re-install.</p>
<p>No dice.</p>
<p>Google shows me others with similar problems, but none related to Heroku, and nothing that looks promising.</p>
<p>I wonder what the <strong>(brew) Doctor</strong> thinks about this (Heroku was installed this way).</p>
<p>The doctor takes her good old time getting back to me on this older Mac. But when she does respond, she says, &ldquo;Dawg, your shit is F&rsquo;ed Up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am paraphrasing, but there are unlinked things, kegs with no formula,, dry taps, an unbrewed dylibs, and likely most importantly, this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This is weird because I had previously checked for an update after an OS update, and I had tried to re-install the tools just to be safe.</p>
<p>In both cases, it said, &ldquo;there are no updates, go away&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Anywho, I run the following:</p>
<p><code>sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools</code></p>
<p><code>sudo xcode-select --install</code></p>
<p>Eventually, notice the popup window (because why install them from the terminal), click OK to continue, and 10 minutes or so later, we are back in business.</p>
<p>The key takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>This shit isn&rsquo;t hard, it just takes patience.</li>
<li>Even those who have done it for a long time still get stuck.</li>
<li>There is nothing wrong with yelling profanities at a computer from the comfort of your basement.</li>

			 <p>Last week&rsquo;s early morning gym commutes were far from ideal. One morning, I attempted to leave and discovered I had a dead battery (actually, two dead batteries). Two days later, I had a close encounter with a deer while driving. Temperatures were in the low 30s at best.</p>
<p>However, at approximately 4:35 am on a Monday (today), I found myself not only commuting to the gym again but also feeling quite excited to get to work.
It struck me then that it all comes down to finding the type of training you genuinely enjoy. While there may be exercises considered &ldquo;the best&rdquo; or &ldquo;better,&rdquo; even engaging in the most mediocre exercise is far better for you than doing nothing.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t always the case for me. It took some trial and error, along with the willingness to start something, fully commit to it, and then be open to finding something that I both enjoyed and that yielded better results.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what truly matters is taking that initial step and sticking with it. It is crucial to listen to your body and determine what it will take to enjoy the work.</p>

			 <p>I am working on a significant update/rewrite of part of KickoffLabs. I had a task to work through what we do in a Sidekiq worker. It was late on Friday when I got to this part of the code, and I decided to punt on it until Monday.</p>
<p>Monday morning, I grab a cup of coffee and sit down to finish this section off and see a comment I missed (and had missed for a long time).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Outside the screenshot, there is an if statement, ensuring this code was not executed in the last four years. Still, it was frustrating that we had missed removing it for so long.</p>
<p>I figured ChatGPT would have a good solution to stay on top of this, but it mostly just tried to explain to me how to use comments. :)</p>
<p>Next up, I asked on <a href="https://twitter.com/scottw/status/1701244816217038929">Twitter</a> (and <a href="https://ruby.social/@Scottw/111047042095713444">Ruby.Social</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any suggestions (other than search) to ensure code like this gets cleaned up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From there, I got a lot of good suggestions.</p>
<p>Two Ruby gems looked interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/searls/todo_or_die">todo_or_die</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Shopify/smart_todo">smart_todo</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If I had to choose, I would go with todo_or_die since it would cause a failure/notification locally. I would rather not wait until there was a pull request/etc.</p>
<p>The rest of the suggestions included if statements and date checks. My favorite, and the one I will likely adopt going forward, is to wrap it in a test that <a href="https://ruby.social/@p8/111047287492099475">fails after a specific date</a>.</p>

			 <p>Fear is our true enemy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the root of most fear is what other people will think of us. It&rsquo;s paralyzing. It&rsquo;s skewing. It distorts the very fabric of our reality &ndash; makes us behave in such utterly insane and cowardly ways that it&rsquo;s hard to even describe.</p>

<p>The older I get, the more I see this every day.  Science says we only use about 10% of brains.  But that is not what holds us back. We hold ourselves back because we are afraid of looking like a failure.</p>

<p>In the past:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google a bit; maybe find someone asking a similar question somewhere (hopefully, do not get distracted by something else).</li>
<li>Goto the docs (which often took Google to find)</li>
<li>Try and find something related to what you were doing.</li>
<li>(Sometimes) Apply what you learn in step #3 to your problem.</li>

			 <p>This piece by Justin Searls has been making the rounds for a week or so.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2023-07-12-the-looming-demise-of-the-10x-developer/">The Fall of the 10X Developer</a></p>
<p>My quick take: AI is leveling the developer playing field a bit. You still need to ask it proper questions to get good results. We have known for quite a while that colleges do not prepare you to be a good developer in the real world. AI won&rsquo;t solve the preparation problem, but it will likely make new hires much more effective sooner.</p>
<p>Still, like any other career, if you just mail it in, you will not truly grow.</p>
<p>We must remember that today&rsquo;s AI is much more pattern recognition than thinking. Maybe that will change, but for now, I still believe it is more assistive for most use cases than a replacement.</p>

			 <p>I mentioned yesterday that I enjoyed the Starrett&rsquo;s chapter on eating in Built to Move. I have been on a high protein kick for a while but was not always getting the 800g recommendation from the book.</p>
<p>I changed that with a set of microwave bowls (I already owned) called AnyDay (see CookAnyDay.com). I am sure there are other similar products out there, so search around (avoid plastic ones), but I enjoy these (do not buy the small ones, the size is not practical).</p>
<p>What I like about them is you can throw just about any vegetables in them and have them steamed in just a couple of minutes. I start most days with about 200-300g of broccoli and cauliflower.</p>
<p>I had seen them recommended by Chef David Chang. I am unsure if he is an investor or a fan (my guess is he is getting paid), but they are beneficial either way. He mentions cooking meat and fish in them, but I have yet to go that far. However, they do an excellent job of reheating almost anything and make for some easy rice and oatmeal dishes.</p>
<p>No referral/affilate here. I am only mentioning them as a recommendation to help you get some more vegetables in your diet quickly.   😁</p>

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781785044557">Outlive</a> by Peter Attia 📚</p>
<p>Outlive is about being proactive in your health and doing what you can to try and prevent the <em>Four Horseman of Chronic Disease</em> (heart disease, cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative disease). It is a long and detailed read. I would recommend starting with the audio version, and if you want to dig deeper, grab a copy of the print edition later.</p>
<p>My biggest takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Heart disease is mostly preventable, and it is baffling that it is still the leading cause of death in the US. The phrase no one dies of a sudden heart attack sounds so wrong initially, but when you realize it was likely 20+ years of bad habits that led to the sudden heart attack, you may want to kick yourself.</li>
<li>Metabolic disorders, like heart disease, are mostly preventable and lead to other issues besides diabetes.</li>

<p>&hellip;you don’t make compelling products — let alone entire platforms — starting from advanced technology and working backward. You start with a vision for the product and platform experience and then create new technology to make it real.</p>

			 <p>Apple&rsquo;s app marketplace is such a massive competitive advantage for Vision Pro. The day it is released, having access to everything iOS (and iPadOS) is an enormous barrier to entry. I am trying to understand how anyone else remotely competes.</p>
<p>Coupled with access to the apps on your Mac and it feels like it is already game over. The price to start is steep, and there is that dangling cord in the back, but I am betting in the short run, this leads to even more Macs being sold as well.</p>

I am far more into for work than entertainment. I rarely watch TV and don&rsquo;t FaceTime/Chat/etc. often. But what I do for hours every day is stand at a desk and navigate many app windows across three monitors.</p>
<p>The thought of a simple desk with just a quality keyboard and my MBP on it is very appealing, even at the $3,500+ price tag (cheaper than the Pro Display 😄).</p>

<li>For the second game every thing logical points you to the Bengals. The Bengals have owned the Chiefs the last 3 times, Mahomes is hobbled at best, and now there is news Kelsey may be slowed down as well.  At one point during the week you could even get the Chiefs at +1.5.  I kick myself for missing those odds, but even at -1.5, something just tells me they are going to pull this one out.</li>

<li>Bengals - I not only expect them to cover, but I think they will win.</li>
<li>49ers - Have I mentioned how much I hate the Cowboys&hellip;the Eagles and 49ers are on a collision course. I expect the 49ers to win by much more than 4.</li>

<p>I have worked through a couple major layoffs. The second was full of remote employees, and the founder wanted to take the time to talk to each employee affected. I knew I was safe and who would ultimately be let go. It was a dreadful day of waiting for everyone (obviously worse for those let go).</p>
<p>Extending this longer than today should be a crime.</p>

<li>Back to a multi-monitor setup. I have been team one larger monitor for the last few years, but I felt like some of the work I have been doing benefits from having more fixed windows.</li>
<li>I moved my desk back against the wall. It had been floating in the room for the last couple of years. I prefer not to stare at a wall in the background, but a floating desk that can also be stood at gets messy on the backside. In addition, the internet speed is nearly 1 Gbps when plugged in vs. 300/400 MPs over wifi.</li>
<li>Removed the XLR mic and went with an <a href="https://amzn.to/3iHxFB3">Elgato Wave 3 USB</a> mic. In quick testing, it seems more than adequate for my needs and does not require a Cloud booster, Focusrite Scarlett, extra cables, etc.</li>
<li>Moved my Anker camera to the top of my MBP instead of the separate arm. Minor change, but one less thing on my desk. I still find it pathetic that Apple has not shipped a better laptop camera. It is cute I can use my iPhone, but who wants to go through all that effort every day.</li>
<li>Semi-related, I disabled &ldquo;Displays have separate spaces.&rdquo; I heavily use spaces and typically have a space for specific tasks with keyboard shortcuts. Once each display has its own space, this gets messy. The downside is I cannot just dock a window in a display across all spaces.</li>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The first completed book of 2023 is <a href="https://amzn.to/3khGDVS">Die With Zero</a> by Bill Perkins (@bp22).</p>
<p>I heard about this book a couple of years ago, but I thought it was a &ldquo;fuck the kids and spend it all&rdquo; kind of book. I was very wrong.</p>
<p>Instead, the book focuses on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how much money you need for the rest of your life and adjust your work habits based on this (slow down when you have enough, find more meaningful work, etc.)</li>
<li>Do your best to have amazing experiences sooner than later. We often push things off for the future, but as you age (and your loved ones as well), your ability to enjoy those experiences in a meaningful way diminishes</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t wait until you die to give money to your children, charities, etc. Like you, a $1 today is far more valuable than a $1 tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
<p>The audio version of the book takes about 4 hours (I think) on 1.2x speed and is worth a listen.</p>
<p>Quick Tip: This <a href="https://www.allthehacks.com/die-with-zero-bill-perkins/">All the Hacks</a> interview made me reconsider reading/listening to the book.</p>

<ul>
<li>49ers (-9) over Seahawks - It looks like 49ers hit a moonshot with Purdy.</li>
<li>Jags over Chargers - Jags +1.5, the money line is tougher. Both coaches are gamblers, but Peterson has actually won in the past.</li>
<li>Bills (-13.5) over Dolphins - 13.5 is a significant number, but I doubt this one will be within 20 points.</li>
<li>Giants (+3) over Vikings - The Giants will win and do not need the points.</li>
<li>Ravens (+9) over Bengals. - The Bengals will win since the Ravens cannot score, but 9 is too many points. If it comes out that the Ravens hate Lamar, I could be swayed.</li>
<li>Buc (+2.5) over the Cowboys - My hate for the Cowboys might cloud my judgment, but they have not looked great. My guess is the Cowboys will win, but it is close because Dak is Dak.</li>

			 <p>I have not said much on Elon/Twitter because I don&rsquo;t think it will matter.</p>
<p>My gut feeling is Twitter for the next couple of years is cooked. If Twitter still had stock, it would be shorted heavily. Heck, it sounds like Tesla is being shorted by proxy.</p>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s willingness to moderate and block (some) hate in the past was not because they cared. Companies with big advertising budgets ultimately do not want their ads showing up on pages filled with hate. It is terrible business.</p>
<p>Elon is on a mission to make Twitter profitable. On this, I am fully aligned with him. However, trying to squeeze money out of your existing customers without offering new value will not work.</p>
<p>What could Twitter add that your average power user would find rewarding enough that they would pay? I have no clue. They could add more ads, but ads are easy to scroll by; I do not think that would move the needle. I pay for YouTube to avoid ads, but those ads consistently cost me 15 to 30 seconds of my time (and my family&rsquo;s).</p>
<p>I do not see the path forward for Elon. Microsoft (as well as Amazon, Google, and Apple) could absorb the cost of running Twitter and use it as an asset for much of its business. This is why I speculated someone like Microsoft will eventually swoop in a purchase it for a significant discount.</p>

			 <p>Outside of social media, email, music, and maps, here are my five most used/essential iOS apps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.dueapp.com">DueApp</a> - Their tagline, &ldquo;Never forget anything, ever again.&rdquo;  It works similarly to reminders, except it consistently reminds you to do something until you set it as done. It has excellent scheduling, snoozing, and more. It syncs perfectly across all of your devices. My only request would be Siri integration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1231744746">Edit</a> - The name makes it impossible to find it in the app store without a link. It is a scratch pad for your phone (actually, it looks like there is a Mac app as well). Its only fundamental feature is an option to highlight everything for quick copying. If you find yourself writing a longer text on a screen without enough space, hop over to Edit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://tot.rocks/">Tot</a> - &ldquo;Tot is a simple app. It lets you collect &amp; edit text on your Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. <a href="https://blog.scottw.com/2022/12/07/tot-this-is.html">As mentioned before</a>, I adore Tot and can&rsquo;t recommend it enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.myfitnesspal.com">MyFitnessPal</a> - I only use it to track calories, but it is the best app I have used for the job. The premium features are pricey, but they help get the job done faster. Should you or shouldn&rsquo;t you track calories is a post on its own, but with this recommendation, you can see where I stand. 😄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://feedbin.com">FeedBin</a> - I guess this borders on &ldquo;social,&rdquo; but it is my list. Feedbin has been my go-to RSS reader for the last couple of years. Besides feeds, it allows you to easily follow Twitter accounts and subscribe to newsletters. This keeps your inbox tidier and keeps me out of the Twitter apps.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A little more on the Feedbin + Twitter integration. You may be thinking everyone&rsquo;s Twitter feed has RSS (I think&hellip;). This integration goes a bit further since it makes it easy to open a thread and see replies/etc.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://scottw.com/2022/12/14/110000.html">Adding Paging Titles for Short Micro.blog Posts</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I noticed posts without titles do not have proper HTML Title tags on my new Micro.blog.</p>
<p>Even as I type this, I kind of get it. <em>How do you have a title without a title?</em> 🤔</p>
<p>Many services rely on a title element when building links, and seeing &ldquo;ScottW&rsquo;s Blog&rdquo; (or whatever I eventually name this thing) looks silly.</p>
<p>I checked the source for a couple other Micro.blog templates and found none of them did anything special to handle the missing title. Most looked something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div style="color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">

</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>After some trial and error, I noticed the <code>.Summary</code> value for the default meta description tag and decided to use that. This is the first &lsquo;code&rsquo; I have written in Hugo, so it might need some more tweaking in the future:</p>

			 <p>My podcast listening usually fluctuates between what I am interested in and what I do while listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>In the past, it has been a lot about software and business, and I was usually listening while taking walks.</p>
<p>These days I usually listen while training at the gym, so my focus is not quite there for something profound like software or business.</p>
<p>I do not have a true favorite, so please ignore the order.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.theringer.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast">Bill Simons</a> - I wouldn&rsquo;t say this is my favorite, but certainly the one I listen to the most. Bill talks a lot about Basketball and Football, which are the two sports I enjoy the most (especially with a spin and some gambling). There is also a fair amount of celebrity/pop culture, which I skip 9 out of 10 times.</p>

It is by far the best athlete-driven podcast I have come across. It will be interesting to see what happens after the season is over (and more sadly if/when Jason retires)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.tntdrama.com/thesteamroompodcast">The Steam Room</a> - Ernie Johnson is great, and Charles Barkley is a living legend. Enough said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.allinpodcast.co">All-In</a> - Rich guys discussing business/politics/etc. It probably shouldn&rsquo;t be as funny as it is, but so be it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://tim.blog/podcast/">The Tim Ferris Show</a> - This might be my longest-running podcast subscription. I started to tune out of the body hacking/etc. stuff, but I have come back for the other interviews. Tim does a great job digging in on questions, and his pre-research is top-notch. Even when someone is there with the goal of selling/launching something, you walk away with some deep insights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I worked on ConvertKit for 3+ years before we made enough for me to take a salary. Sometimes things worth building take a long time. Keep going.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a fine line between being persistent vs. irrational. Do I need to give this a little more time? Or am I wasting time on something that may never work?</p>
<p>There is no true answer to this paradox. I have mentioned in the past there were numerous times in KickoffLab&rsquo;s history that I rationalized that this might be a nice side hustle and thought about moving on to something else. But then the business grew a bit more, and it was again a good idea to keep moving forward.</p>
<p>My assumption, in general, is that far too many jump ship too soon for fear of wasting time and money. The hallways and dinners at most MicroConfs are full of failed business stories in the one to three-month range.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just need to be irrational for a bit longer&hellip;.but not too long. 😏</p>

<p>Urbanek recommends using <code>select</code> in your ActiveRecord queries to limit the fields returned and thus save memory. While this certainly will work, I find it messy long term.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is not obvious what data you have access to. Your code appears to have access to the user object, but most of the data is missing.</li>
<li>Similar to #1, other helpers/decorators/etc. that you have in your codebase may have model requirements that are not obvious as well. You pass along this partial object, and you may have some unintended consequences.</li>
<li>If you use any kind of caching, you may accidentally expose this partial object to completely unaware parts of your app</li>
</ol>
<p>I typically use two approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>pluck</code> - As suggested in the article, you may be giving up some of your model niceties. Still, it is usually a worthwhile trade-off if the amount of data returned warrants optimization. It can also help expose some code that should not live directly within your model.</li>
<li><code>pluck</code> and <code>Struct</code> - when using pluck gets too messy, you can always take the data returned and load it into a struct (or a PORO).</li>
</ol>

<p>I do not follow baseball much (season starts in late September?), but I am excited to see Judge back.</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s terms, this feels like it will be a painful contract in the future. However, as media rights continue to increase and average salaries climb, it may not be too bad. Not to mention the fact the Yankees quite literally print money.</p>

			 <p>We needed to find duplicate characters in multiple arrays for Saturday&rsquo;s <a href="https://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a>.</p>
<p>In the first part of the problem, it was among two arrays, so I did something quick like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div style="color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">
<table style="border-spacing:0;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;width:auto;overflow:auto;display:block;"><tr><td style="vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;">

</span></code></pre></td>
<td style="vertical-align:top;padding:0;margin:0;border:0;;width:100%">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#d0d0d0;background-color:#202020;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">first_array.select { |char| second_array.include?(char) }
</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>This worked as expected, but in part 2, you needed to perform a similar search across three arrays.</p>
<p>I could have chained a second <code>select</code> or duplicated the line entirely, but I figured there was a more straightforward way&hellip;and of course, in Ruby, there is almost always a more straightforward way.</p>
<p><del>I do not have a traditional comp sci background, so my mind rarely jumps to Bitwise operators, but in this case, this is the Bitwise <code>&amp;</code> operator is exactly what we needed.</del></p>
<p><a href="https://ruby.social/@scott/109461560027015018">@scott</a> pointed this is not Bitwise when dealing with strings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the unary and operator. On arrays, #&amp; is a method that returns the set union of two arrays. On integers, it is indeed implemented as a bitwise and.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>Below is roughly what I have done for the last 500 or so days. I lucked into this progression, but I am hoping it will help others in the future.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start today. Do not wait until January 1, your birthday, etc. Just start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start simple. I recommend committing to a daily walk for a couple of weeks. One 20-minute per day is plenty. You can not commit to 20 minutes? How about a 10-minute walk after lunch and dinner? Don&rsquo;t worry about a gym membership, a new diet, etc., for the first couple of weeks. Focus on moving more and more for a couple of weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick a diet that works for you. Low calorie, or low/no-carb, keto, Mediterranean, whatever. Chances are any remotely sensible diet is an improvement over the typical (especially American) diet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a couple of weeks of moving and eating better, find some exercise you enjoy. The exercise could be playing a sport, riding a bike, lifting weights, etc. Remember, you do not have to love the activity, but it should be something you can stick with for a while.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most importantly, be consistent. You do not have to be perfect. We all slip up from time to time or need a break. That&rsquo;s not a problem. Your goal (hopefully) is not to achieve some arbitrary data point. Instead, it should be to improve your long-term health. In a perfect world, you can continue at this for the rest of your life. Treat it like a journey and not some kind of destination.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I could go on and on about this. Each point could easily be another post. But with the new year approaching, I wanted to get something like this out there ASAP.</p>
<p>Once eating better, consistent movement and exercise becomes staples of your daily routine, it is far easier to tune them (and experiment).</p>

<p>Micro.blog has a good mix of simple features and nice apps that I hope over time will let me get back into more writing and sharing.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://scottw.com">old site is still available</a> and will be used for longer forms of writing (if/when I can convince myself to do so).</p>
<p>I also set up a Mastodon account at <a href="https://ruby.social.com/@scottw">https://ruby.social.com/@scottw</a> (well, technically, I have had one for years :))</p>
